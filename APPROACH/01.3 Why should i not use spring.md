You're in a structured  **training program** , with:

* ✅ **Core Java** → covered
* ✅ **Collections + basic Hibernate** → covered (even if surface-level)
* 🔜 **Web development basics** → upcoming
* ❗ Project deadline: 2–3 weeks

So the real question is:

> 🔍 **Should I introduce Spring Boot now (totally new), or build with Tomcat + Servlets + Hibernate (somewhat familiar)?**

---

## 🎯 Final Recommendation Based on  *Your Real-World Training Path:* *

👉 **Stick with:**

* ✅ **Apache Tomcat** (only new thing you need to learn)
* ✅ **Servlets + JSP**
* ✅ **JDBC + Hibernate (very light use)**
* ❌ **Skip Spring Boot** for now

---

## 🧠 Why This Is the Right Move:

### 🟩 You already know **Java and Hibernate basics**

You can use Hibernate in a very **minimal and guided way** — just simple `SessionFactory`, save/fetch — no fancy mappings.

### 🟩 You’ll only have to  **learn one new tool** : Tomcat

Compared to Spring Boot (which brings in REST APIs, annotations, beans, inversion of control, etc.), learning Tomcat and how to deploy a `.war` is  **way easier and faster** .

### 🟨 Web Development Module Is Next

Which means:

* You’ll be learning **Servlets, JSP, HTML/JS** anyway
* This project will **align with your curriculum**
* You’ll **reinforce** your learning instead of working ahead on Spring and struggling

### 🟥 Spring Boot = too much lift *right now*

If you had a month more or had touched Spring Boot earlier, it’d be perfect. But starting from  **zero knowledge** , while juggling deadlines, is high risk.

## ✅ What to Do Now

Here's your new **action plan** for the next few days:

| Task                     | Tools                                                     | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Setup project with Maven | `pom.xml`, IDE                                          | Add Servlet API, Hibernate, PostgreSQL driver    |
| Create folder structure  | `model`,`dao`,`servlet`,`util`,`webapp/WEB-INF` | Clean modular design                             |
| Design DB schema         | PostgreSQL                                                | `vehicle`,`fuel_data`,`engine_data`        |
| Write Hibernate config   | `hibernate.cfg.xml`,`HibernateUtil.java`              | Reuse patterns you saw during Hibernate training |
| Write Servlets           | `VehicleServlet`,`DashboardServlet`                   | Handle routes like `/add`,`/view`, etc.      |
| Write JSPs               | `dashboard.jsp`,`addVehicle.jsp`                      | Build UI, pass data using request attributes     |
| Deploy with Tomcat       | Use `.war` or configure in IDE                          | Easy once you understand directory layout        |
| Keep it simple           | CRUD + dashboard                                          | No login/auth, no REST, no external frontend     |
