## 🧭 What You Know vs What You Need

### ✅ Skills You Already Have

| ✅ Skill   | How It Helps                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Java (OOP) | Build models, services, and business logic       |
| Hibernate  | ORM — maps your Java classes to database tables |
| PostgreSQL | Define, manage and query your data storage layer |
| HTML & CSS | Build frontend structure and basic styling       |
| Maven      | Manage dependencies and build your project       |

That already covers **the data layer and structure** of your backend + frontend!

## 🚧 What’s Missing (And Why You Need It)

Now let’s fill in the remaining essentials  **specifically for your project** .

| 🔍 Technology             | Why You Need It (Project-Specific Use)                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Boot**     | Replaces Apache Tomcat, simplifies web app setup, handles REST APIs |
| **Spring Web**      | To build controllers that accept HTTP requests and return responses |
| **Spring Data JPA** | Makes using Hibernate easier — no boilerplate DAO code             |
| **REST APIs**       | Allows the frontend JS to fetch data from your backend dynamically  |
| **JavaScript**      | Fetch backend data (AJAX) and build interactive dashboards          |
| **Chart.js**        | Display data visually — fuel stats, engine performance, etc.       |
| **Postman**         | To test backend endpoints before frontend is built                  |

## 🎯 Focused Learning Path (Only What You Need)

Here’s how you can **level up efficiently** and in the  **right order** :

### 1. **Spring Boot & Spring Web**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * How to create a Spring Boot project
  * `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`
  * Running the server (`main()` in Spring Boot)
* 🎯 Goal: You should be able to create a REST API endpoint like `/api/vehicles` that returns data

---

### 2. **Spring Data JPA**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * How to use `JpaRepository`
  * Replace manual Hibernate `DAO` classes with Spring interfaces
* 🎯 Goal: You should be able to create `VehicleRepository` and use it in your service layer

---

### 3. **JavaScript (Basics + Fetch API)**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * Basic JS syntax
  * How to use `fetch()` to call backend APIs
  * DOM manipulation to display results
* 🎯 Goal: Load vehicle data from backend and display it on your dashboard using JS

---

### 4. **Chart.js**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * How to create basic line/bar/pie charts
  * How to feed data into charts dynamically from your API
* 🎯 Goal: Visualize things like fuel efficiency trends or RPM over time

---

### 5. **REST API Concepts**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * RESTful endpoint naming (e.g. `/api/vehicles`, `/api/fueldata`)
* 🎯 Goal: Design clean, easy-to-use APIs for your frontend to call

---

### 6. **Postman (or curl/browser)**

* 🔍 Learn:
  * How to test API requests
  * Send POST requests with JSON payloads
* 🎯 Goal: Ensure your backend logic works before connecting it to frontend
